# Twitter Clone

Let's make a simple Twitter clone. Users can post tweets and see everyone's in our app.
To keep the project simple, we do not include a sign-up/login in functionality.
But you can learn CRUD(Create/Read/Update/Delete) through this project.
So there are no user accounts and follow user functionality. You can take up the challenge after you finish the course and add these functionalities
